The goal of RL is for the agent to learn from its experiences and improve its performance over time by maximizing the total accumulated reward.\n\nIn reinforcement learning, there are three main components:\n1. Agent: This is the entity that interacts with the environment. It can be a computer program or even a human. Its objective is to maximize its cumulative reward.\n2. Environment: The context in which the agent operates and receives feedback from. It could be any physical or digital space where actions occur, and there are rewards and penalties associated with those actions.\n3. Reward system: This is the mechanism that tells the agent whether it has made a good decision (reward) or not (penalty). The goal of the agent is to maximize its cumulative reward by making decisions based on this feedback.\n\nThe primary objective for an RL algorithm is to develop policies, which are rules or algorithms, allowing the agent to select optimal actions in any given state, with the ultimate goal being to maximize a certain reward function.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[185,5726,25,79352,254,6405,280,51062,4526,13,185,185,77398,25,2777,246,44417,17812,207,7,7920,8,317,245,1449,280,4871,4526,1066,274,8943,36846,276,1099,11179,457,3950,8370,279,274,4342,11,285,19726,9583,279,254,1020,280,24590,410,36045,13,429,6207,280,36831,317,327,254,8943,276,3071,473,895,10561,285,4377,895,3791,855,766,457,54748,254,3223,35102,11513,13,185,185,774,51062,4526,11,745,418,1853,1969,6170,25,185,16,13,26729,25,1002,317,254,12990,344,70275,366,254,4342,13,809,481,330,245,4541,2043,410,1236,245,3807,13,9904,12982,317,276,26048,895,37493,11513,13,185,17,13,16377,25,429,3733,279,588,254,8943,24667,285,19726,9583,473,13,809,1027,330,688,5315,410,6583,2516,1066,8370,5192,11,285,745,418,24590,285,36045,5329,366,1462,8370,13,185,18,13,88622,1317,25,1002,317,254,12357,344,10496,254,8943,3203,359,643,1401,245,1207,6354,207,7,57936,8,410,441,207,7,3391,59791,633,429,6207,280,254,8943,317,276,26048,895,37493,11513,457,2883,11179,2853,331,437,9583,13,185,185,549,6663,12982,327,274,36831,6712,317,276,2046,11789,11,588,418,6543,410,13018,11,10510,254,8943,276,2732,10883,8370,279,688,2028,1977,11,366,254,17274,6207,1435,276,26048,245,2569,11513,1157,13],"total_duration":77151772257,"load_duration":9104165705,"prompt_eval_count":15,"prompt_eval_duration":2860000000,"eval_count":245,"eval_duration":65161000000}
