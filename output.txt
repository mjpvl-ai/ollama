Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user provided a clear and more efficient prompt input text example. That was helpful because they wanted the LLM to understand exactly what to look for without unnecessary details. Now, they've given another query where they want me to write a clearer prompt for their specific request about an iPhone review of the iPhone 13 Pro.\n\nI should make sure that I address all sensitive information by removing it from the input. So, I'll start by focusing on the key points: brand, model, features, and user ratings or feedback. Maybe include bullet points to structure this better. Also, I need to ensure the prompt is concise and not overwhelming with details.\n\nI should make sure the language remains professional but clear. Using terms like \"brand,\" \"model specifications,\" \"user reviews,\" and \"features\" will cover all necessary information without including sensitive data. It's also good to end with a note about being respectful of user privacy, which adds an extra layer of security.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll craft a prompt that clearly outlines the main points, uses neutral language, removes any sensitive info, and is structured in a way that's easy for the LLM to process. This should meet the user's needs effectively.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nCertainly! To ensure your query is clear and avoids any unnecessary details or potential sensitivity issues, hereâ€™s a refined prompt format:\n\n**Prompt Format:**\n\n*Give me a review of the iPhone 13 Pro.*\n\n---\n\nThis version:\n- Focuses on the key aspect you're requesting (an iPhone review) without including overly detailed information.\n- Removes any potential confusion or ambiguity that could arise from including sensitive data.\n\nLet me know if this meets your needs!","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[2610,525,264,10950,17847,429,45572,304,61442,624,7985,264,48379,323,803,11050,9934,1946,1467,369,279,444,10994,11,715,724,1677,429,678,16216,1995,374,6963,504,279,1196,594,1946,13,151644,46430,752,279,3395,315,279,42448,220,16,18,462,151645,151648,198,71486,11,773,358,1184,311,1492,7269,419,3239,911,279,9934,3561,369,458,444,10994,13,6771,752,1438,432,1495,3019,553,3019,382,5338,11,279,1196,3897,264,2797,323,803,11050,9934,1946,1467,3110,13,2938,572,10950,1576,807,4829,279,444,10994,311,3535,6896,1128,311,1401,369,2041,25165,3565,13,4695,11,807,3003,2661,2441,3239,1380,807,1366,752,311,3270,264,48379,9934,369,862,3151,1681,911,458,12167,3395,315,279,12167,220,16,18,1298,382,40,1265,1281,2704,429,358,2621,678,16216,1995,553,17592,432,504,279,1946,13,2055,11,358,3278,1191,553,21080,389,279,1376,3501,25,6741,11,1614,11,4419,11,323,1196,18102,476,11055,13,10696,2924,17432,3501,311,5944,419,2664,13,7281,11,358,1184,311,5978,279,9934,374,63594,323,537,22024,448,3565,382,40,1265,1281,2704,279,4128,8458,6584,714,2797,13,12091,3793,1075,330,13473,1335,330,2528,28703,1335,330,872,8379,1335,323,330,20304,1,686,3421,678,5871,1995,2041,2670,16216,821,13,1084,594,1083,1661,311,835,448,264,5185,911,1660,48050,315,1196,12345,11,892,11367,458,4960,6193,315,4763,382,97904,432,678,3786,11,358,3278,10770,264,9934,429,9355,49629,279,1887,3501,11,5711,20628,4128,11,28160,894,16216,3546,11,323,374,32930,304,264,1616,429,594,4135,369,279,444,10994,311,1882,13,1096,1265,3367,279,1196,594,3880,13444,624,151649,271,95456,0,2014,5978,697,3239,374,2797,323,54852,894,25165,3565,476,4650,26443,4714,11,1588,748,264,37191,9934,3561,1447,334,54615,15042,25,56177,9,35127,752,264,3395,315,279,12167,220,16,18,1298,42015,44364,1986,2319,510,12,25806,288,389,279,1376,12893,498,2299,34692,320,276,12167,3395,8,2041,2670,38432,11682,1995,624,12,38775,894,4650,21340,476,71768,429,1410,30789,504,2670,16216,821,382,10061,752,1414,421,419,20027,697,3880,0],"total_duration":22451671831,"load_duration":5970308879,"prompt_eval_count":53,"prompt_eval_duration":701000000,"eval_count":372,"eval_duration":15776000000}
